# Solid for Drupal

Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social
applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on
existing W3C standards and protocols

### What does this module do ?

- Allows you as a user to expose a Solid WebID on https://example.com/user/{uid}/solid#me  
Try https://profiles.veltens.org/ to view your profile (very basic right now).

More coming of course.

### Why not name this module 'solid' ?

The namespace is already taken on drupal.org. Suggestions are welcome.
Also this software is still experimental and alpha anyway :)
